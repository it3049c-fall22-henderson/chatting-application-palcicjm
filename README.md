## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 
I believe I deserve an 18/20 for this assignment. The website and application works as intended, however there is one small issue where the application does not recognize who is sending the message, and will show that the user sent a message as if another person had sent it. However, that score excludes the extra credit with the dark mode functionality. 
## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
I was able to construct things relatively easily and could troubleshoot decently well, but I got stuck in a couple of places. The dark mode was implemented easily, however. 
### How long it took me to finish this?
It took me about 3 Hours to complete.

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
The bootstrap class `display-4` styles the text using bootstrap's default styles so that it can act as large, heading text. It works well as an h4 (in relation to display-2 being an h2, and so on). As such, `display-4` makes the text appear much bigger and bolder than other text on the screen, so that it stands out.
