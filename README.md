## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
The bootstrap class `display-4` styles the text using bootstrap's default styles so that it can act as large, heading text. It works well as an h4 (in relation to display-2 being an h2, and so on). As such, `display-4` makes the text appear much bigger and bolder than other text on the screen, so that it stands out.
